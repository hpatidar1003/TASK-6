Password Strength Evaluation Summary

This document summarizes the results of password strength assessments using The Password Meter tool. Each password was analyzed based on its length, character diversity, and susceptibility to common patterns. The tool assigns a score (0â€“100%) and a qualitative rating based on additions and deductions.

Evaluated Passwords

Password               | Score | Complexity   | Notes
------------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
password                | 8%    | Very Weak    | All lowercase; lacks numbers and symbols; fails minimum criteria
Password                | 29%   | Weak         | Adds uppercase; still missing numbers and symbols
Password@123            | 93%   | Very Strong  | Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols; balanced
Mfaisin@20252026        | 100%  | Very Strong  | Long, diverse, and well-structured; exceeds all minimum standards

- Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Placement of numbers or symbols in the middle
- Meeting minimum requirements (length and character diversity)

Deductions:
- Use of only letters or only numbers

- Consecutive or sequential characters (e.g., abc, 123)
- Lack of character type variation

Minimum Requirements:
