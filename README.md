Password Strength Evaluation Summary

This document summarizes the results of password strength assessments using The Password Meter tool. Each password was evaluated based on complexity, character composition, and vulnerability patterns. The tool provides a score (0â€“100%) and a qualitative rating.

Evaluated Passwords

Password              | Score | Complexity   | Notes
----------------------|-------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
password              | 8%    | Very Weak    | Fails minimum requirements; lacks diversity in character types
Password              | 29%   | Weak         | Slight improvement due to uppercase; still lacks numbers/symbols
E@rs1t100             | 90%   | Very Strong  | Meets all criteria; includes mixed case, numbers, and symbols
Password123!          | 93%   | Very Strong  | Balanced composition; minor deductions for sequential characters
M@xSecur3P@ssw0rd!    | 100%  | Very Strong  | Optimal structure; exceeds all minimum standards with minimal flaws

Evaluation Criteria

Additions: Points awarded for character count, diversity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and placement  
Deductions: Penalties for repetition, consecutive characters, and sequential patterns  
Minimum Requirements:
- At least 8 characters
- Contains 3 of 4: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols

Legend

Exceptional: Exceeds minimum standards; maximum bonuses applied  
Very Strong: Meets all criteria; minimal deductions  
Weak / Very Weak: Fails to meet minimum standards; significant vulnerabilities

Usage

This documentation serves as a reference for understanding password strength metrics and improving password hygiene in security-sensitive applications.
